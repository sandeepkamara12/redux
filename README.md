This project is mainly to show the setup with react and redux using the packages react-redux, redux, redux-thunk. In this project I am just showing the file and folder structure as with as deposit and withdraw the amount by click on the buttons.

React-Redux is a library to create a bridge between react and redux.
Redxu-Thunk is a library to handle the async... tasks like passing a value to payload by getting from an API call which is the async... task.
Redux Thunk treats this async... task as an sync... task.
Redux Thunk is a middleware to handle async tasks and to dispatch the actions to the reducers.
